## Purpose

Configuration files used by many softwares on UNIX systems. Use at your own risk.

* editorconfig
* git
* vim
* zsh

## Requirements

* `npm -g install instant-markdown-d` for the Vim `instant-markdown-vim` plugin to work.
* A basic shell to run the scripts.

## Softwares I use in CLI

* [the\_silver\_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) - similar to ack but faster
* [tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) - text mode interface for git
* [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) - a VIM-inspired file manager
* [k](https://github.com/supercrabtree/k) - ls alternative
